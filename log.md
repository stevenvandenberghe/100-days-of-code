# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Friday January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Set up repo, worked with NLTK and Python. Managed to build the corpus, and build frequency distribution.

**Thoughts:** Not sure that I'm not working against the library by building my own frequency counter instead of relying on
built-ins. However, this seems difficult with the French texts I'm dealing with.

### Day 1: Saturday January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started expense tracking app in react native. Got boilerplate code running and displayed something on my phone.
Looked at Weather app example as well.

**Thoughts:** My initial goal is to build a simple expense tracker for my phone. I also have a more ambitious little project in mind:
health track.

### Day 2: Sunday January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Mainly messing around with Python and NLTK. Figured out how to categorize texts in the corpus. Will implement this
to compare 6070 and 8090.

**Thoughts:** These categories could come in handy to do other comparisons as well (expo).
