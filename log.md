# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Friday January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Set up repo, worked with NLTK and Python. Managed to build the corpus, and build frequency distribution.

**Thoughts:** Not sure that I'm not working against the library by building my own frequency counter instead of relying on
built-ins. However, this seems difficult with the French texts I'm dealing with.
