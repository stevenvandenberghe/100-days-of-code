# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Friday January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Set up repo, worked with NLTK and Python. Managed to build the corpus, and build frequency distribution.

**Thoughts:** Not sure that I'm not working against the library by building my own frequency counter instead of relying on
built-ins. However, this seems difficult with the French texts I'm dealing with.

### Day 1: Saturday January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started expense tracking app in react native. Got boilerplate code running and displayed something on my phone.
Looked at Weather app example as well.

**Thoughts:** My initial goal is to build a simple expense tracker for my phone. I also have a more ambitious little project in mind:
health track.

### Day 2: Sunday January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Mainly messing around with Python and NLTK. Figured out how to categorize texts in the corpus. Will implement this
to compare 6070 and 8090.

**Thoughts:** These categories could come in handy to do other comparisons as well (expo).

### Day 6: Thursday January 18, 2018

### Day 7: Friday January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Back to work on the OpenAIRE project.

**Thoughts:** It's running, but I better get some error handling in there.

### Day 8: Saturday January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Went to the office where the OpenAIRE app is getting a ton of data. It must have crashed after approx.
10000 runs with a ConnectionError. Added some exception handling and turned it back on.

**Thoughts:** next time, if it looks like it needs to be able to deal with errors, just implement it straight away. I'm not 
confident my exception handler will hold up.

### Day 10: Monday January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Added module to import projects as well. Did some reading in the Dask documentation.

**Thoughts:** Someone pointed me in the direction of Dask to analyze my huge result set.

## Day 11: Tuesday January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Wrote a concordancer that takes my categorized subcorpora and a keyword
and returns a concordance.

**Thoughts:** I need to find a way to manipulate the concordances. Something with the ConcordanceIndex
should be helpful.
